          Backpacking is a form of low-cost independent travel. It includes
          the use of public transportation, inexpensive hostels and is often
          longer in duration than conventional vacations. This article
          explores the European Backpackers Index from 2018. The dataset
          contains tourist prices and other data for 56 of the most popular
          European cities. Here we showcase how Memgraph's graph traversal
          algorithms can be used to make a real-time traveling recommendation
          system.

        content: |
          The European Backpacker Index (2018) contains information for 56
          cities from 36 European countries. Two cities are connected via
          the `:CloseTo` edge if they are from the same or from the neighboring
          countries. Every edge has an `eu_border` property to indicate
          whether the EU border needs to be crossed to reach the other city.
          The city nodes contain parameters for tourist information such as
          `total_cost_USD`, `cost_per_night_USD`, `local_currency`, etc.
          The country nodes are connected with the `:Borders` edge if they are
          neighboring countries. This edge also has the `eu_border` property.
          Every city node is connected to its parent country node via
          the `:Inside` edge.

          What if we want to visit multiple cities in a single country and
          want to know which country has the most cities in the index?

        content: |
          ```cypher
          MATCH (n:Country)<-[:Inside]-(m:City)
          RETURN n.name AS CountryName, COUNT(m) as HostelCount
          ORDER BY HostelCount DESC, CountryName LIMIT 10;
